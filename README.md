# diarrhedit
the best text editor

# How to run

YOU WILL NEED PYTHON 3 (OF ANY SUBVERSION) INSTALLED TO RUN DIARRHEDIT!!!!! IM TOO LAZY TO CONVERT THE .PY FILE TO AN EXECUTABLE!!

If you have python 3 installed, just run diarrhea_edit.py or go into the command line and type:

**for windows users**
`python diarrhea_edit.py`

**for mac and linux**
`python3 diarrhedit.py`

and thats it
